    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Khachapuri is a s a traditional Georgian dish of cheese-filled bread. The bread is leavened and allowed to rise, molded into various shapes, 
        and then filled in the center with a mixture of cheese (fresh or aged, most commonly, specialized khachapuri cheese), eggs, and other ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>It is popular in Georgia, both in restaurants and as street food. It is Georgia's national dish, included in the list of the intangible cultural heritage of Georgia.
        February 27th is National Khachapuri Day, to celebrate Georgia's signature pastry as well as to promote its recognition internationally. 
        The khachapuri is served hot from the oven, otherwise it loses the taste of its unique cheese mixture and becomes bitter.
