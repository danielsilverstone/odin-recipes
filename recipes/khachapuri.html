    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Khachapuri is a s a traditional Georgian dish of cheese-filled bread. The bread is leavened and allowed to rise, molded into various shapes, 
        and then filled in the center with a mixture of cheese (fresh or aged, most commonly, specialized khachapuri cheese), eggs, and other ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>It is popular in Georgia, both in restaurants and as street food. It is Georgia's national dish, included in the list of the intangible cultural heritage of Georgia.
        February 27th is National Khachapuri Day, to celebrate Georgia's signature pastry as well as to promote its recognition internationally. 
        The khachapuri is served hot from the oven, otherwise it loses the taste of its unique cheese mixture and becomes bitter.

        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed, for dusting</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cheese Blend:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
        <li>4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>4 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter, cut into 4 pats</li>
        <li>sea salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make dough: Combine milk, water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. 
            Let stand until yeast forms a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. 
            Add 2 cups flour, olive oil, and salt; mix until a sticky dough forms.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Knead for about 3 minutes, 
            adding in remaining 1/4 cup flour as needed, until dough is very soft but still workable. 
            Form into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled in volume, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While dough rises, prepare cheese blend: Toss together feta, Monterey Jack, and mozzarella cheese in a medium bowl. 
            Refrigerate cheese mixture until needed.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough and turn out onto a floured surface. Flatten slightly and cut in half. 
            Place 1 dough half on a sheet of parchment paper dusted with flour. 
            Roll out into a rectangle about 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Arrange 1/4 of the cheese mixture in 2 rows, 1 to 2 inches from the longest sides. 
            Roll sides up tightly over cheese, forming a canoe shape. 
            Pinch and twist ends to seal. Trim excess parchment and lift dough onto a baking sheet. 
            Shape and stuff remaining dough half. Fill canoes with remaining cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. 
            Form a well in the center of each khachapuri using a spoon; crack an egg inside each well.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake until eggs are mostly set, 3 to 4 minutes. Place 2 pats butter over each egg, then sprinkle with salt and cayenne. 
            Plate khachapuri; tear off one end and use it to stir butter into egg.</li>
