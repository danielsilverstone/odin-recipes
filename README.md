# odin-recipes

This project is a simple recipe website, which will feature a few 
recipes, and images of how each dish will come out. I incroperated various HTML skills such as: 
adding multiple web pages, links, embedding images, use of ordered and unordered lists. I found this
project to have been completed smoothly, with a functional product as the end result.
